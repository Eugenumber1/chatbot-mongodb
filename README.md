## How to run?
Clone the repository to your local machine. Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the values of the keys. Next, run `make run` from the root of the project. This command will build the docker images of the FastAPI backend and MongoDB instance and deploy them locally. 
You can later try FastAPI swagger by navigating to `https://localhost:8000/docs`.
